A web based EPUB reader based on Monocle

[epub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) is a popular format for distribution of eBooks. There are lots of epub reader software are available for both desktops and mobiles. We developed this project as a part of our B.Tech academic curriculum.

While reading ebooks on a computer or on the mobile, people are facing problems understanding some of the words. This is particularly magnified when the person is new to the language. (Imagine that you are reading books in English. You want to refer dictionary every now and then. Right?)

If the person reading the book had to refer dictionary every two lines, it affects the reading flow and pleasure. Addressing this problem is the main objective of our project.
