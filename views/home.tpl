<h2><a>ABSTRACT</a></h2>
      <p>epub (ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB) is a format which is used for 
eBohoks. There are lots of epub reader software are available for both 
desktops and mobiles. There are lots of features available in those epub 
readers such as dictionary reference for words in the book, web 
searching, some readers even provide text to speech. 

While reading ebooks on a computer or on the mobile, people are facing 
problems understanding some of the words. This is particularly magnified 
when the person is new to the language. (Imagine that you are reading 
books in English. You want to refer dictionary every now and then. Right?) 

If the person reading the book had to refer dictionary every two lines, 
it affects the reading flow and pleasure. Addressing this problem is the 
main objective of our project.
